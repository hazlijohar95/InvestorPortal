## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Development

1. **Never commit secrets** to version control
2. **Use environment variables** for sensitive configuration
3. **Validate all inputs** before processing
4. **Use parameterized queries** for database operations
5. **Implement proper error handling** without exposing internals

### Authentication

1. **Hash passwords** properly (never store plaintext)
2. **Use secure session configuration**
3. **Implement proper logout functionality**
4. **Validate user permissions** for all operations
5. **Use HTTPS** for all authentication flows

### Database

1. **Use prepared statements** for all queries
2. **Implement least privilege** for database users
3. **Encrypt sensitive data** at rest
4. **Regular backup verification**
5. **Monitor for unusual activity**
